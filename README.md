# Talino Labs Coding Challenge

This repository contains my (Bon/Tony's) take on the coding challenge imposed by Talino Labs for their hiring process. As a disclaimer, some inspiration was taken from Google and Youtube.

## Structure

Here's the structure of the repository:

- **problem_set_1**
    - `palindrome_pairs.rb`: A Ruby script for the Palindrome Pairs problem.
    - `README.md`: Detailed explanation and instructions for the Palindrome Pairs problem.

- **problem_set_2**
    - `valid_parenthesis.rb`: A Ruby script for the Valid Parenthesis problem.
    - `README.md`: Detailed explanation and instructions for the Valid Parenthesis problem.

- **problem_set_3**
    - `longest_increasing_subsequence.rb`: A Ruby script for the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem.
    - `README.md`: Detailed explanation and instructions for the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem.

## How to Navigate

You can navigate through the repository using your file explorer or the terminal. Each problem set is contained in its own directory.

## How to Run the Files

To run the Ruby scripts, navigate to the directory of the problem set you want to work on using the terminal, and then run the Ruby script using the `ruby` command. For example, to run the `palindrome_pairs.rb` script, you would do:
